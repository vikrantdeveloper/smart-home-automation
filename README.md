# Smart-Home-Automation
Smart home automation via ARM M7 Based processor running RT-Thread OS

# Description
Smart automation systems are a combination of sensors and controller which monitor the switching of the lighting system.

# Sensor Implementation
Passive infrared sensors sense the radiations emitted by the living object.
PIRs are made of a pyroelectric sensor (which you can see below as the round metal can with a rectangular crystal in the centre), which can detect levels of infrared radiation. 
When the sensor is idle, both slots detect the same amount of IR, the ambient amount radiated from the room or walls or outdoors. When a warm body like a human or animal passes by, it first intercepts one half of the PIR sensor, which causes a positive differential change between the two halves.

# Hardware Framework
The development board used in this project is STM32 F722ZE-RE which has ARM CORTEX â€“ M7 as the CPU with 512kb of flash memory and 32 kHz internal clock

# Software Framework
The Operating system used in the project is RT-Thread RTOS. RT-Thread OS is compact operating system especially designed to run on the cortex ARM M series for IoT based application.
